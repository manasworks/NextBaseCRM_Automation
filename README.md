# Cydeo: Game of Throws

## Git Branching Model
* Create new branch per feature/test - describe it with JIRA ticket + description with dashes (eg. CY19-66-initial-project-setup)
* Commit changes often and try to describe them well
* After finishing feature or test create a Pull Request
* Share it with team members for review
* If changes are needed, the author of PR will apply them
* Merge the PR to master
